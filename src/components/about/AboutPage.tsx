        Hey there! I&apos;m a self-taught full-stack developer hailing from
        India who loves hacking cool stuff! <strong>Next.js</strong> and{" "}
        <strong>Remix.run</strong> are my go-to weapons, but sometimes, I dive
        into the world of NFT smart contracts with <strong>Scilla</strong> on{" "}
        <strong>Zilliqa</strong>. You could say I&apos;m a jack of all trades,
        master of fun. ðŸ˜„

        I&apos;ve had my hands on two major NFT smart contracts for{" "}
        <strong>The Soulless Citadel</strong>, the largest NFT project on
        <strong> Zilliqa.</strong> One of these bad boys is a full-blown NFT
        marketplace, packed with bidding, listing, purchasing, and more. The
        other is an NFT minting contract with fancy discount mechanisms like
        premining and whitelist. Oh, and I also whipped up the{" "}
        <strong>GraphQL API</strong> for the Soulless Game, a real-time card
        game where you can play with the NFTs you own. Pretty cool, huh?

        When I&apos;m not busy typing away, I love sharing my coding adventures
        on my <a href="/blog">blog</a>. I also unwind with books on life and
        startups, and nothing beats coding with some chill lofi beats in the
        background. ðŸŽ§
