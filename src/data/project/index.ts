    // Gita GPT, a source of solace inspired by the wisdom of Shree Krishna ðŸ¦š, developed using Next.js and OpenAI GPT-3.5. This unique project offers personalized advice based on verses from the Bhagavad Gita, tailored to address life's challenges. The platform quickly gained recognition, with features in prominent Indian news outlets such as **TimesNow, The Economic Times, News18**, and FirstPost.\n\nWith impressive statistics, the website has garnered over **5,42,574+** pageviews, **3,29,884+** unique visitors, and processed **8,09,102+** API requests. To deliver surprisingly fast response times, Gita GPT employed Vercel edge functions with streaming support, allowing data to be streamed in parallel while generating advice from OpenAI.\n\nTo keep the service free for all users, various optimizations were implemented to minimize OpenAI API usage. As the user base rapidly expanded, a rate-limiter was introduced to manage the maximum number of daily requests per user, ensuring a fair and accessible experience for everyone.`,
