      Hi there, I'm Kishan. I build modern web products with a focus on
      efficiency and scalability, along with an interest in AI products. I
      currently work as a Full-Stack Developer at Quinence, where I lead and
      contribute to various projects.
      <br />
      <br />
      Most recently, at Quinence, I have been leading the redevelopment of Fuschia
      Careers, a high-volume recruiting platform, enhancing its performance and functionality
      while integrating AI (LLM) to optimize recruiter workflows. Additionally, I
      work on a personalized tech training platform, Modern Fullstack, where I designed
      and developed the website architecture and backend, improving the platform’s
      performance by 10X. I was also involved in building the course content.<br
      />
      <br />Previously, I worked with The Soulless Citadel, a blockchain NFT
      project, where I developed a high-performance, real-time game backend and
      smart contracts for the marketplace, facilitating over 2,200 transactions
      and generating sales of nearly $370,000. <br />
      <br />I’ve always been passionate about web performance, optimizing
      systems to be fast and scalable, while maintaining attention to detail and
      a strong product mindset. Whether it's building email automation tools,
      crafting interactive courses, or working on AI-driven platforms, my goal
      is always to enhance the user experience through thoughtful engineering
      and innovation. <br />
      <br />If you’re interested in collaborating or have a project in mind,
      feel free to reach out to me at
