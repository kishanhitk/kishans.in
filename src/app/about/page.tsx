          Hey there! I&apos;m a self-taught full-stack developer hailing from
          India who loves hacking cool stuff! <strong>Next.js</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>Remix.run</strong> are my go-to weapons, but sometimes, I dive
          into the world of NFT smart contracts with <strong>Scilla</strong> on{" "}
          <strong>Zilliqa</strong>. You could say I&apos;m a jack of all trades,
          master of fun. ðŸ˜„

        <Paragraph>
          I&apos;ve had my hands on two major NFT smart contracts for{" "}
          <strong>The Soulless Citadel</strong>, the largest NFT project on
          <strong> Zilliqa.</strong> One of these bad boys is a full-blown NFT
          marketplace, packed with bidding, listing, purchasing, and more. The
          other is an NFT minting contract with fancy discount mechanisms like
          premining and whitelist. Oh, and I also whipped up the{" "}
          <strong>GraphQL API</strong> for the Soulless Game, a real-time card
          game where you can play with the NFTs you own. Pretty cool, huh?

          When I&apos;m not busy typing away, I love sharing my coding
          adventures on my <Link href="/blog">blog</Link>. I also unwind with
          books on life and startups, and nothing beats coding with some chill
          lofi beats in the background. ðŸŽ§
